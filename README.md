# statistics-reference.github.io
Reference guide from statistics to artificial intelligence. Let's change the world. https://statistics-reference.github.io/

**Goals of this github:**
* Reference guide for practitioners, learners, and educators
* Cut down time to obtain necessary information
* Zero-cost way for self-learners to obtain quality knowledge
* Repository of standardized and unified knowledge

I hope to help push society forward by providing a tool that will allow individuals to learn and produce at a faster pace.  Too much time is spent sifting through noise and fluff.
