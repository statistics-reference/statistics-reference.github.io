I will attempt to order the information where the most relevant information appears first. The goal is to cut down noise and to get you relevant information as quickly as possible. I hope this sets this guide apart from others. The book is currently divided into three sections: Descriptive Techniques: Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Diagnostics, Etc… Inferential Techniques: Estimation, Models, Prediction, Etc… Computational Techniques: Simulation, Approximation, Algorithms, Etc… There is obvoiusly some overlap so when needed, things will be repeated or at the very least, linked. In general, the most important information will be bulleted, bolded, and come first. In depth information will usually be included later on in each section. Appendices will include further information like proofs. Practitioners will likely find the beginning of each section useful. Learners will probably find the middle to end of the sections most useful. "],

Each section covers mean inference under different conditions and assumptions The sections are: Mean Inference (n.u.f): normal, iid, univariate, frequentist, known variance Mean Inference (n.u.f.u): normal, iid, univariate, frequentist, unknown variance 6.1 Normal-Univariate-Frequentist-Known-Variance This section covers population mean inference when the population distribution is assumed to be normal and population variance is known ex ante. More specifically, mean inference is performed under the following assumptions and conditions: Assumptions: Population follows a normal distribution Observations are iid Known population variance ex ante Other Conditions, Criteria, or Attributes: Univariate mean inference Frequentist perspective 6.1.1 Overview and Summary Key Takeaways: We calculate the Z-statistic and use the Z-distribution (standard normal distribution) to create the confidence interval since the population variance is known. If the population variance is unknown, we would use the T-statistic and T-distribution. Overview and Summary: Here we discuss how to perform univariate mean inference when the population is assumed to be normal, our observations are iid, and population variance is known ex ante. Inference is done from a frequentist’s perspective. As it is not very often that we know the population variance, this technique is not very useful. 6.1.2 Point Estimation Key Takeaways: Under normal assumption, both maximum likelihood estimation and method of moments will result in the same estimate of the mean as the formula below. The below formula will produce an unbiased estimate no matter what the population distribution is. Proof. Point Estimation: The following formula can be used to calculate an unbiased estimate of the population mean using sample data: \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}{x_{i}}}{n}\\) Where: \\(\\bar{x}\\) = unbiased estimate of population mean \\(n\\) = sample size \\(x_{i}\\) = your sample observations The formula above not only produces an unbiased estimate under the assumptions on this page, but always produces an unbiased estimate of the population mean no matter the distribution (as long as the population mean exists). 6.1.3 Confidence Interval Since we make the assumptions that the population variance is known ex ante (along with other necessary assumptions), we can construct a confidence interval using the Z-distribution (standard normal distribution), Z-table, and Z-statistic (Z-score). The formula for the Z-statistic is: \\(Z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\) Z follows a normal distribution with mean of 0 and variance of 1. 6.1.4 Suggested Steps Point Estimation: Make sure you know the population variance ex ante Obtain sample data and ensure it is iid. Random samples are usually iid, by definition. Check that the sample data fits the normal assumption using methods such as QQ plot Calculate the sample mean using the following formula: \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}{x_{i}}}{n}\\) Confidence Interval: Continuing from above, now calculate the Z-statistic using: Determine 6.1.5 Sources and Useful Links 6.2 Normal-Univariate-Frequentist-Unknown-Variance This section covers population mean inference under the following assumptions and conditions: Assumptions: Population follows a normal distribution Observations are iid Unknown population variance Other Conditions, Criteria, or Attributes: Univariate mean inference Frequentist perspective For mean inference under other assumptions and conditions, please visit: Mean Inference (n.u.f): normal, iid, univariate, frequentist, known variance Mean Inference (n.u.f.u): normal, iid, univariate, frequentist, unknown variance 6.2.1 Overview and Summary Key Takeaways: We calculate the T-statistic and use the T-distribution to create the confidence interval since the population variance is unknown. If the population variance is known, we would use the Z-statistic and Z-distribution. Overview and Summary: Here we discuss how to perform univariate mean inference when the population is assumed to be normal, our observations are iid, and population variance is unknown. Inference is done from a frequentist’s perspective. This is a common way to perform mean inference. 6.2.2 Point Estimation Key Takeaways: Under normal assumption, both maximum likelihood estimation and method of moments will result in the same estimate of the mean as the above formula. The above formula will produce an unbiased estimate no matter what the population distribution is. Proof. Point Estimation: The following formula can be used to calculate an unbiased estimate of the population mean using sample data: \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}{x_{i}}}{n}\\) Where: \\(\\bar{x}\\) = unbiased estimate of population mean \\(n\\) = sample size \\(x_{i}\\) = your observations The formula above not only produces an unbiased estimate under the assumptions on this page, but always produces an unbiased estimate of the population mean no matter the distribution (as long as the population mean exists). 6.2.3 Confidence Interval Since we make the assumptions that the population variance is unknown, we can construct a confidence interval using the T-distribution T-table. The formula for the T-statistic is: \\(T = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\) Where: \\(\\bar{x}\\) = unbiased estimate of population mean \\(n\\) = sample size \\(S\\) = sample standard deviation using the following formula 6.2.4 Hypothesis Testing Since we make the assumptions that the population variance is unknown, we can perform hypothesis testing using the T-distribution, T-table, and T-statistic (T-score). 6.2.5 Suggested Steps Point Estimation: Obtain sample data and ensure it is iid. Random samples are usually iid, by definition. Check that the sample data fits the normal assumption using methods such as QQ plot Calculate the sample mean using the following formula: \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}{x_{i}}}{n}\\) Confidence Interval: Continuing from above, now calculate the confidence interval using: 6.2.6 Sources and Useful Links 6.3 General-Univariate-Frequentist This section covers estimating the population mean under the following assumptions and conditions: Assumptions: Population can follow any shaped distribution with finite mean (not necessarily normal) Observations are iid Population variance can be known or unknown (check if it can be finite or infinite) Other Conditions, Criteria, or Attributes: Univariate mean inference Frequentist perspective For mean inference under other assumptions and conditions, please visit: Mean Inference (n.u.f): normal, iid, univariate, frequentist, known variance Mean Inference (n.u.f.u): normal, iid, univariate, frequentist, unknown variance Mean Inference (g.u.f): general, iid, univariate, frequentist 6.3.1 Overview and Summary Key Takeaways: With the shape of the population distribution unknown, we will always use the T-statistic and T-distribution to create the confidence interval. This is true regardless if we know the population variance or not. When your sample size exceeds 30 or so (need citation), the results from doing a T-test will be very similar to the results from a Z-test. This is because the T-distribution converges to a Z-distribution (standard normal distribution) as your sample size increases. The rule of thumb is 30, but in practice it will depend on the skewness of the population distribution. The more skewed your population is, there more samples we need. (need citation) make sure not confuse with CLT. With sample sizes much larger than 30, we could use the Z-statistic for hypothesis testing and confidence interval building but it’s usually just easier to always use the T-statistic. Overview and Summary: Here we discuss how to perform univariate mean inference when the population can be any shaped distribution (with finite mean) and our observations are iid. Inference is done from a frequentist’s perspective. This is a common way to perform mean inference. 6.3.2 Point Estimation Key Takeaways: Under normal assumption, both maximum likelihood estimation and method of moments will result in the same estimate of the mean as the above formula. The above formula will produce an unbiased estimate no matter what the population distribution is. Proof.
