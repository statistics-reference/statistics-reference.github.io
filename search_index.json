["index.html", "Statistics: A Reference About", " Statistics: A Reference Stats-AI 2020-09-14 About This “book” is designed to be a reference for statistics and data science. I will attempt to order the information where the most relevant information appears first. The goal is to cut down noise and to get you relevant information as quickly as possible. I hope this sets this guide apart from others. One day, I also hope that the material will cover relevant topics for AI researchers. The book is currently divided into three sections: Descriptive Techniques: Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Diagnostics, Etc… Inferential Techniques: Estimation, Models, Prediction, Etc… Computational Techniques: Simulation, Approximation, Algorithms, Etc… There is obvoiusly some overlap so when needed, things will be repeated or at the very least, linked. In general, the most important information will be bulleted, bolded, and come first. In depth information will usually be included later on in each section. Appendices will include further information like proofs. Practitioners will likely find the beginning of each section useful. Learners will probably find the middle to end of the sections most useful. "]
