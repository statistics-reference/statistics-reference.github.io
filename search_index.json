It will attempt to present information where the most relevant information appears first. The goal is to cut down noise and to get you relevant information as quickly as possible. I hope this sets this guide apart from others. The book is currently divided into three sections: Descriptive Techniques: Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Diagnostics, Etc… Inferential Techniques: Estimation, Models, Prediction, Etc… Computational Techniques: Simulation, Approximation, Algorithms, Etc… There is obviously some overlap so when needed, things will be repeated or at the very least, linked. In general, the most important information will be bulleted, bolded, and come first. In depth information will usually be included later on in each section. Appendices will include further information like proofs. Practitioners will likely find the beginning of each section useful. Learners will probably find the middle to end of the sections most useful. Goals There are lofty goals for this project. I hope to take the first step in creating a proof of concept via this “book”. I would like to create subsequent resources down the line but will need help as the subject areas become less familiar. I hope to eventually turn these series of repositories into an organization that aims to provide top notch knowledge in the realm of statistics, computer science, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This book and subsquent projects will look to solve the following problems: Slow Learning Rate While technology itself has advanced very quickly, we are still limited by the human brain. We as humans only have so much time to learn things and can only learn so fast. As many who have studied hard may know, while one may easily pick up things again after learning it 5 years ago, it is rare that one can instantly recall the exact details at any moment in time. This organization hopes to be able to provide a reference that one can easily access in that moment of forgetfullness. Currently, there are many resources that do allow one to quickly refresh or learn/relearn a concept. However, there are two issues with current solutions. (1) There are a lot of noise. The many blogs out there have the goal of capturing your attention and driving clicks. You have to sift though a lot of noise just to get an answer that probably could have been given to you in one or two sentences. This increases the time it takes to learn a concept or complete a task. (2) It is fragmented. There are numerous sources, but each are written by different authors and in different language. For example, depending on field, independent variable can be called a (feature, predictors, covariate, regressor, factor, explanatory variable, input variable, and more…). A unified approach would dramtically decrease the time spent on learning and reviewing a topic. It would also make learning the subject material much more accessible to newer individuals. The goal of this project is to not only provide a unified repostiary, but for it to also be organized Lack Of Accessibility As much “free” education there is out there, there still isn’t a good source of truly top notch education that is free (without profit motives). There are many individuals out there who due to various circumstances do not have the opportunity to obtain an education from a top notch school, and as a result, are essentially locked out of the ability to pursue their dreams and contribute to society. Reasons go beyond the lack of finances. It could be that they did not follow the typical timeline of going to college at the age of 18. It could be because mental health issues, development disorders, personality quirks or external distractions made it difficult for someone to learn in a structured environment where there is an expectation to hit certain targets at certain times. It could be an immigrant from a developing country, who came over to find a better life, but is already 30 years old. Yet, all these individuals like to learn and want to contribute to society, and often in the area of science. This project will give these individuals rhe knowledge at zero cost…forever. Access to information is just one part of the equation. The ability for one to quickly digest and understand the information is another. An additional goal of this project is to be able to provide information in a manner that can be easily understood by someone who does not have an advanced degree. I have ideas on how to slowly build up the vocab base for future projects. The two problems this project seeks to solve make this project truly unique. It will not look to sell individuals the hopes and dreams of what obtaining education may potentially provide, but instead, it looks to directly provide the tools to individuals so that they can forge their own path, start solving problems, and push the human race forward. How To Help There are many ways to help out. Currently, I am working on creating a “proof of concept” reference book so that one can get an idea of how I plan to cut down the time it takes for people to to learn and obtain knowledge. After this, help can involve: Donations: This would be both a show of support and give me confidence that this can one day be a full time project. Expert Advice: This can come in the form of producing content for the “book”, editing, or helping out with anything else (ex. web development, how to structure the data) Spread The Word: In order for this to become an organization, we need to spread the word and gain support. Sharing the book in links would be a great first step! I hope to one day partner with a larger organization as there are definitely goals that require additional collaboration. For example, in order to provide the most relevant information to individuals, I eventually will need in house machine learning algorithms. Additionally, as the goal is to provide knoweldge at zero cost to the users, the organization will need to find other ways to support itself. I have many ideas on how to make this work.

Each section covers mean inference under different conditions and assumptions The sections are: Mean Inference (n.1.f.k): normal, iid, univariate, frequentist, known variance Mean Inference (n.1.f): normal, iid, univariate, frequentist, unknown variance Mean Inference (g.1.f): general, iid, univariate, frequentist Mean Inference (n.2+.f): normal, iid, multivariate, frequentist Mean Inference (g.2+.f): general, iid, multivariate, frequentist Mean Inference (n.1.b.k): normal, iid, univariate, Bayesian, known variance Mean Inference (n.1.b): normal, iid, univariate, Bayesian, unknown variance Mean Inference (g.1.b): general, iid, univariate, Bayesian Mean Inference (n.2+.b): normal, iid, multivariate, Bayesian Mean Inference (g.2+.b): general, iid, multivariate, Bayesian 6.1 Normal-Univariate-Frequentist-Known-Variance This section covers population mean inference when the population distribution is assumed to be normal and population variance is known ex ante. More specifically, mean inference is performed under the following assumptions and conditions: Assumptions: Population follows a normal distribution Observations are iid Known population variance ex ante Other Conditions, Criteria, or Attributes: Univariate mean inference Frequentist perspective 6.1.1 Overview and Summary Under the assumptions above, inference can be done using the Z-statistic and Z-distribution (standard normal distribution). Key Takeaways: An unbiased estimate for the population mean can be calculated using the typical formula for mean. We calculate the Z-statistic and use the Z-values and Z-distribution (standard normal distribution) to create the confidence interval and perform hypothesis testing since the population variance is known. If the population variance is unknown, we would use the T-statistic and T-distribution. In Depth: Like in most situations where we are looking to make inferences about a population parameter, we need (1) a point estimate and (2) a way to determine the precision of our point estimate. In this case, we use the typical formula for sample mean (described below) as our point estimate and the sampling distribution as a way to determine precision. Under the assumptions outlined, the sampling distribution of the mean follows exactly a normal distribution. This is a result of a property of normal random variables. Linear combinations of normal random variables are normally distributed with mean and variance given below. If \\(a_{i}\\) and \\(b\\) are constants, \\(x_{i}\\) is a normal random variable, then the linear combination of \\(x_{i}\\) such as: Linear Combination: \\(b + a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2} + ... + a_{n}x_{n}\\) Will be normally distributed with: Mean = \\(b + a_{1}\\mu_{1} + a_{2}\\mu_{2} + ... + a_{n}\\mu_{n}\\) Variance = \\(a_{1}^2\\sigma_{1}^2 + a_{2}^2\\sigma_{2}^2 + ... + a_{n}^2\\sigma_{n}^2\\) Where: \\(\\mu_{i}\\) is the mean of the distribution from which \\(x_{i}\\) comes from \\(\\sigma_{i}^2\\) is the variance of the distribution from which \\(x_{i}\\) comes from That is: \\(Linear Combination \\sim N(Mean, Variance)\\) \\(b + a_{1}x_{1} + ... + a_{n}x_{n} \\sim N(b + a_{1}\\mu_{1} + ... + a_{n}\\mu_{n}, a_{1}^2\\sigma_{1}^2 + ... + a_{n}^2\\sigma_{n}^2)\\) The means and variances of the normal distribution from which each normal random variable comes from do not have to be the same. However, in this section, since we are focusing on estimating the mean of normal random variables drawn from the same population, there is only a single population mean and variance. Proof and more information is given in Degroot(309). As a result, the mean of observations, \\(x\\), from a normal distribution with known variance will have a sampling distribution that is normal with: Mean = \\(\\mu\\) Variance = \\(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\) Where: \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the population distribution from which normal random variable \\(x\\) comes from \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance of the population distribution from which normal random variable \\(x\\) comes from That is: \\(\\bar{x} \\sim N(\\mu,\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n})\\) Because we know that the sampling distribution of the mean is normal and we also know the mean and variance of the sampling distribution, we can use the sampling distribution to make inferences about the precision of our estimate. Recall what the sampling distribution is. It is the distribution of sample means calculated from different random samples of size n drawn from the same population. As our point estimate is unbiased, this distribution gives us an idea as to the possible values the true population mean may be. We use confidence intervals to determine a range of values that is likely to capture the true population parameter. We use hypothesis testing to determine how likely our population parameter takes on a specific or range of values. Inference via confidence intervals and hypothesis testing is discussed in later sections. 6.1.2 Point Estimation Most commonly we use the following formula to generate an unbiased estimate of the population mean. The formula is: \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}{x_{i}}}{n}\\) Where: \\(\\bar{x}\\) = unbiased estimate of population mean \\(n\\) = sample size \\(x_{i}\\) = your sample observations The formula above not only produces an unbiased estimate under the assumptions in this section, but always produces an unbiased estimate of the population mean no matter the distribution (as long as the population mean exists). Key Takeaways: The above formula will produce an unbiased estimate no matter what the population distribution is. While you could use maximum likelihood estimation, method of moments, or other estimation techniques to produce a point estimate for the population mean, in practice we just use the formula above. Under the normal assumption, both maximum likelihood estimation and method of moments will result in the same estimate of the mean as the formula above. In Depth: The proof that the above formula provides an unbiased estimate of the population mean no matter the shape of the population distribution (as long as the population mean exists) is given here. 6.1.3 Confidence Interval The formula for the confidence interval given our assumptions is: \\(\\bar{x} \\pm z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt(n)\\) Where: \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean \\(\\alpha\\) is the significance level \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation, which we know ex ante \\(n\\) is the sample size Like constructing all confidence intervals, we choose a level of \\(\\alpha\\) (Type II error) first, then build the interval. The confidence interval gives us a range around our sample estimate that may capture the true population parameter. Key Takeaways: * We build the confidence interval using the Z-distribution as opposed to T-distribution when the population is normal and variance is known * For a given level of alpha, the interval built using the Z-distribution will be narrower than one built using the T-distribution In Depth: The confidence interval gives us a range for which the population mean is likely to be in. It is a way for us to measure how precise our point estimate is. In general, given a level of \\(\\alpha\\) we want narrower confidence intervals to produce more precise estimates. One can use the formula above, to see how a change in one variable may increase or decrease the width of our confidence interval (while holding \\(\\alpha\\) constant). When it comes to interpretation, from a frequentist standpoint, the confidence interval is not the probability that the population will fall into the range. Instead, it is the probability that our confidence interval captures the population parameter.

For hypothesis testing, we either use Z to determine a p-value. Or we see if Z exceeds a certain threshold value. Key Takeaways: We calculate the Z-statistic as opposed to T-statistic when the population is normal and variance is known In Depth: For more information on hypothesis testing, visit here. 6.1.5 Suggested Steps Here are some suggested steps for performing mean inference in practice. Point Estimation: Make sure you know the population variance ex ante Obtain sample data and ensure it is iid. Random samples are usually iid, by definition. Check that the sample data fits the normal assumption using methods such as QQ plot. If it not normal, you cannot use this method. Calculate the sample mean using this formula Confidence Interval: Continuing from above… Choose an \\(\\alpha\\) Construct the confidence interval using this formula The confidence interval is a range that has a \\((1 - \\alpha)\\) percent change of capturing the true population mean Hypothesis Testing: Continuing from above… Set up your \\(H_{0}\\) and \\(H_{a}\\) statements Calculate the Z-statistic Using either statistical software or the Z-Table, use either the p-value or critical value to determine whether or not to reject your null hypothesis Interpret your results 6.1.6 Sources and Useful Links Sources: Degroot: Probability And Statistics (4th) - DeGroot, Schervish Useful Links: 6.2 Normal-Univariate-Frequentist-Unknown-Variance This section covers population mean inference when the population distribution is assumed to be normal and population variance is unknown.

This is true regardless if we know the population variance or not. When your sample size exceeds 30 or so (need citation), the results from doing a T-test will be very similar to the results from a Z-test. This is because the T-distribution converges to a Z-distribution (standard normal distribution) as your sample size increases. The rule of thumb is 30, but in practice it will depend on the skewness of the population distribution. The more skewed your population is, there more samples we need. (need citation) make sure not confuse with CLT. With sample sizes much larger than 30, we could use the Z-statistic for hypothesis testing and confidence interval building but it’s usually just easier to always use the T-statistic. Overview and Summary: Here we discuss how to perform univariate mean inference when the population can be any shaped distribution (with finite mean) and our observations are iid. Inference is done from a frequentist’s perspective. This is a common way to perform mean inference. 6.3.2 Point Estimation Key Takeaways: Under normal assumption, both maximum likelihood estimation and method of moments will result in the same estimate of the mean as the above formula.
